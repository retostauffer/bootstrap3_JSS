		As a matter of principle, <strong>JSS charges no author fees or subscription fees</strong>. Our editors, reviewers, and programmers are volunteers.
		Universität Innsbruck, Universität Zürich, and UCLA Statistics provide support staff, website
		maintenance, website hosting, and some graduate student support.
		Because of our success and growth we do need more resources in the future.
		You can support us by becoming a member of the <a href="http://www.foastat.org/" target="_new">Foundation for Open Access Statistics</a>
		at <a href="http://www.foastat.org/" target="_new">www.foastat.org</a>,
